 <p>
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently taking a technical course on software development, whose pedagogical project can be found [here] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/19zMWJBXv2PkKn_IFPtnkPTRp4hyQRaLb/view), through which I aim to improve as someone passionate about resolving problems. <br>
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on various projects, for I have only 3 years of studying. <br>
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [gi.sig@hotmail.com](mailto:gi.sig@hotmail.com) <br>
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have already taken part on some projects in the institute I study at as a research fellow as well as participated in The Coding School's High School Introduction to Quantum Computing program, when I was initiated in Qiskit, an IBM's Python library turned to this field that is, in one word, sick!
